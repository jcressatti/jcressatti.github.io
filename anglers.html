    </header>

<p>Justin (C)</br>
"Il Lanziere Pazzo"</br>
What he lacks in drafting etiquette, he more than makes up for in treacherous breakaways. This veteran angler thrives in the splash zone and "walleye chop" cobblestones. Rumours of "RHF4LIFE" team affiliations follow him like a hungry tiburón drafting a lone rider on the descent.</p>
<p>Steve (C)</br>
"Pescarote"</br>
The reigning wearer of the Maglia Rosa, holding the number 1 spot overall. A modern-day Fausto Coppi of the waves, this fearless leader will be the first off the line, searching the deep for monstrous catches – his personal "Cima Coppi".</p>
<p>Roy</br>
“Il Debuttante Friulano”</br>
Directly from the challenging hills and vineyards of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, here comes Roy, making his grand debutto in the Rock Hard Fishing Giro d'Ontario! As a newcomer to this particular stage, he's still finding his cadenza and figuring out the strategia for tackling these Canadian waters. Will he be a sorpresa attacker, launching a solo breakaway for a monster catch? Or will he ride cautiously in the main gruppo, learning the ropes? One thing is certain: his Friulan spirit is strong, and he's ready to add some serious carattere to the competition. Benvenuto, Roy! Andiamo a pescare!</p>
<p>Jonny</br>
“Lascialo Cucinare”</br>
Once a broken man waiting for the ammiraglia on a distant pier, now Jonny is the ragazzo who catches the fish and brings them home like a winning stage sprinter to the team bus. Sober enough to know the route and the rapporti, and "hydrated" enough to truly enjoy the discesa, you’ll find Jon cruising the 'seas' for American gold. The reigning Walleye King, holding the record for the longest "solo breakaway" at 59 cm in 2023. Chapeau!
</p>
<p>Mauro</br>
“Il Pirata del Lago”</br>
Forget mountains, Mauro is the "Marco Pantani" of the waves! Known as "Il Pirata del Lago," he attacks the water like Pantani attacked the climbs – with relentless energy and absolutely zero regard for conserving energy. His motto isn't just ABC ("Always Be Catching"); it's ABC: Attacca! Bevi Caffè! Cattura! (Attack! Drink Coffee! Catch!). With double rods flying and a look in his eye that says "I'm going for a solo breakaway," Mauro is always on the hunt for the Maglia Rosa fish. Keep your eyes peeled, this Pirate is unpredictable and always thrilling to watch on the water!</p>
<p>Rob</br>
“Il Contabile del Luccio"</br>
An instant success since he burst onto the RHF scene like a surprise attack on a flat stage, climbing the ranks to 3rd place in 2023. Was it his algorithm for finding the best spots, or his ability to see through the noise and ignore any advice offered on the ride up (the boat ride) that led to his triumph? We may never know. All we know is there's a thirty-three and a third chance of survival for the fish, the numbers don't lie, and they spell disastro for you, walleye!
</p>
<p>Ryan (C)</br>
"Il Grappler Poseidone"</br>
Rock Hard's very own Old Man of the Sea/Veteran Rider. Equipped with his customary... let's say, "aerodynamic fishing gear," you won’t catch this captain needing a "sticky bottle" (aid from the team car). Running clean since 2019, a founding member of RHF and half the duo of "RHF4LIFE," a journey on Ryan’s boat harks back to the time of Odysseus navigating treacherous waters, encountering mythical fish-gods along the way. A true endurance grimpeur of the lake.</p>
<p>Joey</br>
"Solo la Punta"</br>
This swashbuckling privateer has spent his recent years raiding the "Spanish Main St." Now sailing the sweet water seas like a fuga artist, you’ll often find this pescatore's boat filled with canto and allegria while patrolling the shallows for green and gold treasures lurking below. He's always looking for that small advantage, just the tip...
</p>
<p>Shawn (C)</br>
"Il Capitano Squalo"</br>
What better hunter of fish is there than a shark in the Peloton? A trained avvocato, this angler knows all about the art of presentation – whether it's a lure or a legal brief. Never without his trusty murder gloves, Shawn basks in the sweet smell of a freshly landed catch. An expert filettatore, brandishing knives as sharp as his wit. He's always ready to attack the school!
</p>
<p>Tim</br>
“Melba”</br>
After an impressive "Rock Hard™" performance at a Carota Invitational Golf Tournament, Tim was successfully recruited into the RHF universe to target the illustrious gravel lizard. An experienced catfisher/rouleur, this master craftsman and "silver surfer" has brought his talents to the Great White North in pursuit of the catch of a lifetime and untold fishy glory. A true passista of the lake.</p>
